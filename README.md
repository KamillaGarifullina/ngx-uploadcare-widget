Uploadcare Widget is an HTML5 file uploader, a part of the
[Uploadcare][uploadcare] ecosystem.

## Install

```
npm install ngx-uploadcare-widget
```

## Usage

The basic wrapper usage scenario can be described in four steps.

### Step 1. Import the module

```typescript
import { UcWidgetModule } from 'ngx-uploadcare-widget';
```

### Step 2. Import the module to yours

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    ...,
    UcWidgetModule,
  ],
  ...
})
...
```

### Step 3. Use the component in your template

```html
<!- with default markup->
<ngx-uploadcare-widget
  images-only="true"
  public-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY">
</ngx-uploadcare-widget>

<!- without any markup->
<ngx-uploadcare-widget-custom
  images-only="true"
  public-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY">
</ngx-uploadcare-widget-custom>

```

### Step 4. Have fun with the widget events

The component currently supports three widget events:

* `on-change`
* `on-upload-complete`
* `on-progress`

Here is how you can handle those three,

```html
<ngx-uploadcare-widget
  images-only="true"
  public-key="demopublickey"
  (on-upload-complete)="yourOnUploadHandler($event)"
  (on-change)="yourOnChangeHandler($event)"
  (on-progress)="yourOnProgressHandler($event)">
</ngx-uploadcare-widget>
```

You can learn more about this widget events in our
[docs][docs-widget-js-change].

### Events

* [on-upload-complete](https://uploadcare.com/docs/api_reference/javascript/widget/#widget-on-upload-complete)
* [on-change](https://uploadcare.com/docs/api_reference/javascript/widget/#widget-on-change)
* on-progress - fired several times while upload with progress data.

Events usage example:

```javascript
  onUpload(info) {
    console.log('fired Event "onUpload"');
    console.log(info);
  }

  onProgress(progress) {
    console.log('fired Event "onProgress with data:"');
    console.log(progress);
  }

  onChange(file) {
    if(!file) {
      return;
    }
    console.log('fired Event "onChange"');
  // input file parameter depends on "multiple-files" widget attribute
    if(this.multipleFiles) {
  //  file contains 2 methods:
  //  .promise() - returns the general promise for all uploaded files which resolves into an uploaded file group info
  //  .files() - returns an array of promises: one per each uploaded file. Each promise resolves into an uploaded file info
      console.log(file);
      if(file.promise) {
        file.promise().then((groupInfo) => {
          console.log('resolved general promise from "onChange" with data:');
          console.log(groupInfo);
        });
      }
      if(file.files) {
        file.files().forEach((promise) => {
          promise.then((fileInfo) => {
            console.log('resolves file promise with file info:');
            console.log(fileInfo);
          });
        });
      } else {
  // file contains uploaded file info
        console.log(file);
      }
    }
  }

```

### Methods

The components provides following public methods:

* `clearUploads()` - Removes all current uploads from the widget. You can use the method to reset a form even if a user has already uploaded some files.
* `reset(clearUploads = false)` - Resets the widget, You can also remove all the current uploads if `clearUploads` is set to `true`
* `openDilaog()` - Opens Uploadcare widget dialog with current configuration.

All methods are accessible from a parent component via the `@ViewChild()` approach.

## Localization

It is possible that your locale is not available in the widget yet. If thatâ€™s
the case, contributing your locale might be a good idea. This can be done by
forking the [main repository][widget] and adding a localization file
[here][widget-locales].

The quick way of implementing your locale would be overriding any of the
existing ones via the [`UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_TRANSLATIONS`][docs-widget-locales]
property.
