Uploadcare Widget is an HTML5 file uploader, a part of the
[Uploadcare][uploadcare] ecosystem.

## Install

```
npm install ngx-uploadcare-widget
```

## Usage

The basic wrapper usage scenario can be described in four steps.

### Step 1. Import the component

```typescript
import { UcWidgetComponent } from 'ngx-uploadcare-widget';
```

### Step 2. Add the component to your module

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    ...,
    UcWidgetComponent,
  ],
  ...
})
...
```

### Step 3. Use the component in your template

```html
<ngx-uploadcare-widget
  images-only="true"
  public-key="YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY">
</ngx-uploadcare-widget>
```

### Step 4. Have fun with the widget events

The component currently supports two widget events:

* `on-change`
* `on-upload-complete`

Here is how you can handle those two,
 
```html
<ngx-uploadcare-widget
  images-only="true"
  public-key="demopublickey"
  (on-upload-complete)="yourOnUploadHandler($event)"
  (on-change)="yourOnChangeHandler($event)">
</ngx-uploadcare-widget>
```

You can learn more about the two widget events in our
[docs][docs-widget-js-change].
 
## Configuration

**Please note:** for now, the component only supports one-time initialization.
If you change any of the attributes at runtime, they will not affect the widget.
The behavior is temporary and will be fixed in the future release.

### Supported input attributes

All the following attributes correspond to the ones listed in the
[widget docs][docs-widget-config], but without the `data-` prefix.

## Localization

It is possible that your locale is not available in the widget yet. If thatâ€™s
the case, contributing your locale might be a good idea. This can be done by
forking the [main repository][widget] and adding a localization file
[here][widget-locales].

The quick way of implementing your locale would be overriding any of the
existing ones via the [`UPLOADCARE_LOCALE_TRANSLATIONS`][docs-widget-locales]
property.
